90,"What does ""CD"" stand for in CI/CD?",Container Deployment,Continuous Delivery/Deployment,Cluster Discovery,Centralized Dashboard,,B,"Continuous Delivery ensures code changes can be released quickly, while Continuous Deployment automatically deploys them to production.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,CI/CD
91,Which stage in a typical CI/CD pipeline for Kubernetes usually involves creating a container image?,Testing,Building,Deployment,Monitoring,,B,"The build stage compiles code (if necessary) and packages the application and its dependencies into a container image (e.g., Docker).",Cloud Native Application Delivery,CI/CD
92,"Which tool is commonly used in CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes?",Kubernetes,Docker,Jenkins / GitLab CI / GitHub Actions,Prometheus,,C,"Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Argo CD, Flux etc., orchestrate the steps within a CI/CD pipeline.",Cloud Native Application Delivery,CI/CD
93,What is the primary goal of Application Delivery in a cloud native context?,To secure the cluster,To monitor resource usage,To reliably deploy & manage apps,To provision infrastructure,,C,Application delivery focuses on the processes and tools used to get applications running reliably and efficiently in the environment.,Cloud Native Application Delivery,Application Delivery Fundamentals
94,"In Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), what defines a set of permissions?",Role / ClusterRole,ServiceAccount,RoleBinding / ClusterRoleBinding,User,,A,A Role (namespace-scoped) or ClusterRole (cluster-scoped) contains rules that represent a set of permissions on resources.,Container Orchestration,Security
95,"What object binds a Role or ClusterRole to a user, group, or ServiceAccount?",Secret,ConfigMap,NetworkPolicy,RoleBinding / ClusterRoleBinding,,D,A RoleBinding (namespace-scoped) or ClusterRoleBinding (cluster-scoped) grants the permissions defined in a Role/ClusterRole to subjects.,Container Orchestration,Security
96,"If you need a Pod to run on every single Node in the cluster (or a subset), which controller is most suitable?",Deployment,StatefulSet,DaemonSet,Job,,C,"DaemonSets ensure that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod, useful for cluster services like log collectors or node monitors.",Kubernetes Fundamentals,Kubernetes Resources
97,What is a primary difference between a Deployment and a StatefulSet?,StatefulSets manage Pods,Deployments are for databases,StatefulSets provide stable IDs,Deployments use PVs,,C,"StatefulSets provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of Pods, including stable network identifiers and persistent storage.",Kubernetes Fundamentals,Kubernetes Resources
98,"Which Kubernetes API object is used to manage external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP/S?",Service (LoadBalancer type),NodePort Service,Ingress,ExternalName Service,,C,Ingress provides HTTP/S routing rules to manage external users' access to services within the cluster based on hostnames or paths.,Container Orchestration,Networking
99,What design pattern involves running an additional container within a Pod to provide auxiliary functions (like logging or monitoring) to the main application container?,Init Container,Sidecar Container,Ephemeral Container,Job Container,,B,The Sidecar pattern adds helper containers alongside the main application container within the same Pod network/storage namespace.,Kubernetes Fundamentals,Containers
100,What fundamental concept allows Kubernetes to maintain the desired state declared by the user?,Imperative Commands,Control Loop / Reconciliation,Manual Scaling,Direct Node Access,,B,"Kubernetes controllers operate on control loops, constantly comparing the desired state (from API objects) with the actual cluster state.",Kubernetes Fundamentals,Kubernetes Architecture
